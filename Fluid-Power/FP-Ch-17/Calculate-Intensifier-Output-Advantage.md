# Calculating Mechanical Advantage of a Hydraulic Intensifier

We are given from the previous example:

- Piston bore diameter = 2.5 inches  
- Rod diameter = 1 inch  
- Input pressure = 600 psig  
- Output pressure ≈ 3,750 psig  

---

## Step 1: Understand the formula

The **mechanical advantage (MA)** of an intensifier is the **ratio of output force to input force**.  

For a hydraulic intensifier:

    MA = P_out / P_in

Where:  
- P_out = output pressure  
- P_in = input pressure  

> This works because **force = pressure × area**, and the **area ratio is what multiplies the pressure**.

---

## Step 2: Apply the formula

    MA = P_out / P_in
    MA = 3,750 / 600

---

## Step 3: Divide

    3,750 ÷ 600 = 6.25

---

## Step 4: Include units

- Mechanical advantage is **dimensionless** (just a ratio)

---

## Answer

Mechanical Advantage:

    MA ≈ 6.25

---

### Note

- This matches the **area ratio** we calculated before:

    Area Ratio = A_piston / A_rod = 4.9087 / 0.7854 ≈ 6.25  

- The mechanical advantage **tells you how many times the input force is amplified**.  
- Inputting 1 unit of force on the rod side produces 6.25 units of force on the piston side.
