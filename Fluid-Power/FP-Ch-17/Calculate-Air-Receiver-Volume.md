# Calculating Air Receiver Volume (Standard Formula)

We are given:

- Airflow = 500 CFM  
- Drawdown time = 3.25 minutes  
- Pressure band = 12 psig  
- Atmospheric pressure ≈ 14.7 psia  
- Goal: Find air receiver volume in cubic feet (ft³)

---

## Step 1: Understand the formula

The standard formula for sizing an air receiver:

    V = (Airflow × Drawdown Time × Atmospheric Pressure) / Pressure Band

Where:  
- V = receiver volume in cubic feet (ft³)  
- Airflow in CFM (cubic feet per minute)  
- Drawdown time in minutes  
- Pressure Band = ΔP in psig  
- Atmospheric pressure in psia (≈ 14.7 psia)  

> This formula assumes **gauge pressure for the pressure band** and moderate compression.

## Step 2: Identify the values

- Airflow = 500 CFM  
- Drawdown = 3.25 minutes  
- Pressure Band = 12 psig  
- Atmospheric Pressure = 14.7 psia

---

## Step 3: Apply the formula

    V = (500 × 3.25 × 14.7) / 12

---

## Step 4: Multiply numerator

    500 × 3.25 = 1,625  
    1,625 × 14.7 ≈ 23,887.5

---

## Step 5: Divide by pressure band

    23,887.5 ÷ 12 ≈ 1,990.63 ft³

---

## Step 6: Include units

    Receiver Volume ≈ 1,990.63 cubic feet

---

## Answer

Air Receiver Volume:

    V ≈ 1,990.63 ft³
