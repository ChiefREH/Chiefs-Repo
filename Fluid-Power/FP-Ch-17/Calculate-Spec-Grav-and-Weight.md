# Calculating Specific Weight and Specific Gravity of Hydraulic Oil

We are given:

- Volume of hydraulic oil = 210 cubic feet (ft³)  
- Weight of hydraulic oil = 1,800 lbs  
- Goal: Find **Specific Weight (γ)** and **Specific Gravity (SG)**

---

## Step 1: Specific Weight (γ)

Specific Weight is:

    γ = Weight / Volume

Where:  
- γ = specific weight in lbs/ft³  
- Weight = 1,800 lbs  
- Volume = 210 ft³

---

### Step 2: Apply the formula

    γ = 1,800 / 210

---

### Step 3: Divide

    γ ≈ 8.5714 lbs/ft³

---

### Step 4: Include units

    Specific Weight, γ ≈ 8.57 lbs/ft³

---

## Step 2: Specific Gravity (SG)

Specific Gravity is the **ratio of the fluid’s density to water’s density**:

    SG = γ_fluid / γ_water

Where:  
- γ_water ≈ 62.4 lbs/ft³ (standard at 4°C)  
- γ_fluid = 8.5714 lbs/ft³ (from Step 1)

---

### Step 3: Apply the formula

    SG = 8.5714 / 62.4

---

### Step 4: Divide

    SG ≈ 0.137

---

## Step 5: Include units

- Specific Gravity is **dimensionless** (ratio, no units)

---

## Answer

- Specific Weight:  
    γ ≈ 8.57 lbs/ft³  

- Specific Gravity:  
    SG ≈ 0.137

---

### Note:

- This seems extremely low for hydraulic oil (normally ~7.2–7.5 lbs/gal or ~50–57 lbs/ft³).  
- **Double-check units:**  
  - 1 cubic foot = 7.48 gallons  
  - If the weight seems unusually low, the volume or weight may need unit conversion.
