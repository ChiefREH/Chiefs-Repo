# Calculating Compressor Run Time Percentage

We are given:

- Compressor **run time** = 6 minutes  
- Compressor **off time** = 2 minutes  
- Goal: Find **run time percentage (%)**

---

## Step 1: Understand the formula

Compressor run time percentage is:

    Run Time % = (Run Time / Total Cycle Time) × 100

Where:  
- Total Cycle Time = Run Time + Off Time

---

## Step 2: Calculate total cycle time

    Total Cycle Time = 6 + 2 = 8 minutes

---

## Step 3: Apply the formula

    Run Time % = (6 / 8) × 100

---

## Step 4: Divide

    6 ÷ 8 = 0.75

---

## Step 5: Multiply by 100

    0.75 × 100 = 75%

---

## Step 6: Include units

    Compressor Run Time ≈ 75%

---

## Answer

Compressor Run Time Percentage:

    Run Time ≈ 75%

# Note

- This is also called the duty cycle of the compressor.
- It tells you what fraction of the time the compressor is actively running.
