# Converting PSIA to PSIG

We are given a pressure:

- **Absolute Pressure (PSIA):** 225 psia  
- **Goal:** Convert to **Gauge Pressure (PSIG)**

---

## Step 1: Understand the difference

- **PSIA (pounds per square inch absolute):** Measures pressure **relative to a perfect vacuum**.  
- **PSIG (pounds per square inch gauge):** Measures pressure **relative to atmospheric pressure**.  

**Key formula:**

    Gauge Pressure (PSIG) = Absolute Pressure (PSIA) - Atmospheric Pressure (PSI)

Atmospheric pressure at sea level is usually 14.7 psi.

---

## Step 2: Identify the values

- Absolute Pressure = 225 psia  
- Atmospheric Pressure = 14.7 psi

---

## Step 3: Apply the formula

    Gauge Pressure = 225 - 14.7

---

## Step 4: Calculate

    Gauge Pressure = 210.3

---

## Step 5: Include units

    Gauge Pressure = 210.3 psig

---

## Answer

Gauge Pressure = 210.3 psig
