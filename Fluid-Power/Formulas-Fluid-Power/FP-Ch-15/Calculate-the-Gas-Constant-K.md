# Calculating the Gas Constant (k)

We are given:

- Pressure = 600 psia  
- Temperature = 35 °C  
- Goal: Find the gas constant (k) in consistent units  

---

## Step 1: Understand the formula

For an ideal gas:

    P = k × T

Where:  
- P = absolute pressure  
- T = absolute temperature (Kelvin)  
- k = proportionality constant

Rearranging for k:

    k = P / T

---

## Step 2: Convert temperature to Kelvin

    T(K) = T(°C) + 273.15
    T = 35 + 273.15 ≈ 308.15 K

---

## Step 3: Identify the values

- P = 600 psia (already absolute)  
- T = 308.15 K

---

## Step 4: Apply the formula

    k = P / T
    k = 600 / 308.15

---

## Step 5: Divide

    k ≈ 1.947 psia/K

---

## Step 6: Include units

    k ≈ 1.947 psia per Kelvin

---

## Answer

Gas constant:

    k ≈ 1.947 psia/K

---

# Note

- Temperature must be in Kelvin for proportionality.
- Pressure must be absolute (psia), which it is in this problem.
- This is for a given gas volume, so k is specific to this system.
