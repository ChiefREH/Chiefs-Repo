# Calculating Cylinder Volume with Constant Pressure (Charles's Law)

We are given:

- Cylinder diameter = 5 inches  
- Cylinder height = 10 inches  
- Initial temperature (T1) = 200 K  
- Final temperature (T2) = 500 K  
- Pressure remains constant  
- Goal: Find the final volume (V2)

---

## Step 1: Understand the formula

At **constant pressure**, **Charles’s Law** applies:

    V1 / T1 = V2 / T2

Where:  
- V1 = initial volume  
- V2 = final volume  
- T1 = initial temperature (in Kelvin)  
- T2 = final temperature (in Kelvin)

Solve for V2:

    V2 = V1 × (T2 / T1)

## Step 2: Calculate initial volume of the cylinder

Cylinder volume formula:

    V = π × (D/2)² × H

Where:  
- D = cylinder diameter  
- H = cylinder height

Step by step:

- D = 5 in → radius r = D/2 = 2.5 in  
- V1 = π × 2.5² × 10  
- 2.5² = 6.25  
- 6.25 × 10 = 62.5  
- 62.5 × π ≈ 196.35 in³

So:

    V1 ≈ 196.35 in³

## Step 3: Apply Charles’s Law

    V2 = V1 × (T2 / T1)
    V2 = 196.35 × (500 / 200)

---

## Step 4: Divide temperatures

    500 / 200 = 2.5

---

## Step 5: Multiply by V1

    V2 = 196.35 × 2.5 ≈ 490.88 in³

---

## Step 6: Include units

    V2 ≈ 490.9 in³

---

## Answer

Final Volume:

    V2 ≈ 490.9 cubic inches

# Note

- We did not need to convert pressure, because it is constant.
- Temperatures must be in Kelvin for Charles’s Law.
