# Calculating Fluid Velocity in a Pipe

We are given:

- Flow rate = 55 gallons per minute (GPM)  
- Pipe internal diameter = 0.75 inches  
- Goal: Find velocity in feet per second (ft/s)

## Step 1: Understand the formula

The velocity of fluid in a pipe is:

    V = Q / A

Where:  
- V = velocity (ft/s)  
- Q = volumetric flow rate (ft³/s)  
- A = cross-sectional area of the pipe (ft²)

**Steps:**  
1. Convert flow rate from GPM to ft³/s.  
2. Calculate the cross-sectional area of the pipe.  
3. Divide flow rate by area to get velocity.

## Step 2: Convert flow rate (GPM → ft³/s)

1 gallon = 0.13368 ft³  

    Q (ft³/min) = 55 × 0.13368 ≈ 7.3524 ft³/min

Convert minutes to seconds:

    Q (ft³/s) = 7.3524 / 60 ≈ 0.1225 ft³/s

## Step 3: Calculate cross-sectional area of the pipe

Pipe diameter = 0.75 in → convert to feet:

    D = 0.75 / 12 = 0.0625 ft

Pipe cross-sectional area (circle):

    A = π × (D/2)²
      = 3.1416 × (0.0625 / 2)²
      = 3.1416 × (0.03125)²
      = 3.1416 × 0.00097656
      ≈ 0.00307 ft²

## Step 4: Calculate velocity

    V = Q / A
      = 0.1225 / 0.00307
      ≈ 39.9 ft/s

---

## Step 5: Include units

    Velocity ≈ 39.9 ft/s

## Answer

Velocity ≈ 39.9 ft/s
