# Converting Temperature from Kelvin to Fahrenheit

We are given a temperature:

- **Temperature:** 109 K  
- **Goal:** Convert to **Fahrenheit (°F)**

---

## Step 1: Understand the relationship

The formula to convert **Kelvin to Fahrenheit** is:

    °F = (K - 273.15) × 9/5 + 32

Where:  
- K is temperature in Kelvin  
- °F is temperature in Fahrenheit

---

## Step 2: Identify the values

- K = 109

---

## Step 3: Apply the formula

    °F = (109 - 273.15) × 9/5 + 32

---

## Step 4: Subtract 273.15

    109 - 273.15 = -164.15

---

## Step 5: Multiply by 9/5 (or 1.8)

    -164.15 × 9/5 = -295.47

---

## Step 6: Add 32

    -295.47 + 32 = -263.47

---

## Step 7: Include units

    Temperature = -263.47 °F

---

## Answer

Temperature = -263.47 °F
