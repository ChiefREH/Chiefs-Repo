# Converting Temperature from Fahrenheit to Kelvin

We are given a temperature:

- **Temperature:** 508 °F  
- **Goal:** Convert to **Kelvin (K)**

---

## Step 1: Understand the relationship

The formula to convert **Fahrenheit to Kelvin** is:

    K = (°F - 32) × 5/9 + 273.15

Where:  
- °F is temperature in Fahrenheit  
- K is temperature in Kelvin

---

## Step 2: Identify the values

- °F = 508

---

## Step 3: Apply the formula

    K = (508 - 32) × 5/9 + 273.15

---

## Step 4: Subtract 32

    508 - 32 = 476

---

## Step 5: Multiply by 5/9

    476 × 5/9 ≈ 264.44

---

## Step 6: Add 273.15

    264.44 + 273.15 ≈ 537.59

---

## Step 7: Include units

    Temperature ≈ 537.6 K

---

## Answer

Temperature ≈ 537.6 K
