# Calculating Force from Pressure and Area

We are given:

- Pressure = 225 psig  
- Cylinder Area = 3.5 in²  
- Goal: Find the resulting force in pounds (lbf)

---

## Step 1: Understand the formula

The relationship between pressure, force, and area is:

    Force (lbf) = Pressure (psi) × Area (in²)

Where:  
- Pressure is in psi (pounds per square inch)  
- Area is in square inches  
- Force will be in pounds-force (lbf)

---

## Step 2: Identify the values

- Pressure = 225 psig  
- Area = 3.5 in²

---

## Step 3: Apply the formula

    Force = 225 × 3.5

---

## Step 4: Multiply

    Force = 787.5 lbf

---

## Step 5: Include units

    Force = 787.5 pounds-force (lbf)

---

## Answer

Force = 787.5 lbf

# Note

- Does force require absolute pressure?
    - In most hydraulic and pneumatic cylinder problems, the pressure given is the pressure applied to the piston, which is usually gauge pressure.
    - The atmospheric pressure is already "balanced" on the other side of the piston (unless there is a vacuum or back pressure).
    - Therefore, you can use PSIG directly for calculating the force the fluid exerts on the piston.
