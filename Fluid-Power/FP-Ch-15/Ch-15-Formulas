# Converting PSIG to PSIA

We are given a pressure:

- **Gauge Pressure (PSIG):** 325 psig  
- **Goal:** Convert to **Absolute Pressure (PSIA)**

---

## Step 1: Understand the difference

- **PSIG (pounds per square inch gauge):** Measures pressure **relative to atmospheric pressure**.  
- **PSIA (pounds per square inch absolute):** Measures pressure **relative to a perfect vacuum**.  

**Key formula:**

    Absolute Pressure (PSIA) = Gauge Pressure (PSIG) + Atmospheric Pressure (PSI)

> Atmospheric pressure at sea level is usually **14.7 psi**.

---

## Step 2: Identify the values

- Gauge Pressure = 325 psig  
- Atmospheric Pressure = 14.7 psi

---

## Step 3: Apply the formula

    Absolute Pressure = 325 + 14.7

---

## Step 4: Calculate

    Absolute Pressure = 339.7

---

## Step 5: Include units

    Absolute Pressure = 339.7 psia

---

### ✅ Answer

**339.7 psia**
