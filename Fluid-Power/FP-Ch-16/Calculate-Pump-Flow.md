# Calculating Pump Flow Rate (GPM)

We are given:

- Pump displacement = 3.25 cubic inches per revolution (in³/rev)  
- Pump speed = 1500 revolutions per minute (rpm)  
- Goal: Find flow rate in gallons per minute (GPM)

---

## Step 1: Understand the formula

Pump flow rate can be calculated as:

    Q = Displacement × RPM

Where:  
- Q = volumetric flow per minute (in³/min)  
- Displacement = in³/rev  
- RPM = rev/min

Then convert **cubic inches per minute** to **GPM**:

    1 gallon = 231 in³  
    Q(GPM) = Q(in³/min) ÷ 231

---

## Step 2: Calculate flow in cubic inches per minute

    Q = 3.25 × 1500
    Q = 4875 in³/min

---

## Step 3: Convert cubic inches to gallons

    Q(GPM) = 4875 ÷ 231 ≈ 21.1 GPM

---

## Step 4: Include units

    Flow ≈ 21.1 GPM

---

## Answer

Pump Flow Rate:

    Q ≈ 21.1 gallons per minute (GPM)

---

# Note

- Multiply displacement by RPM to get volumetric flow.
- Convert to gallons using 1 gallon = 231 in³.
- This is the ideal flow; real pumps may be slightly less due to leakage.
