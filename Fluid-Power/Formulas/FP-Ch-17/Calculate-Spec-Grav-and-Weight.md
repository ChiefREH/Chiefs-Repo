# Calculating Specific Weight and Specific Gravity of Hydraulic Oil

We are given:

- Volume of hydraulic oil = 210 cubic feet (ft³)  
- Weight of hydraulic oil = 1,800 lbs  
- Goal: Find **Specific Weight (γ)** and **Specific Gravity (SG)**

---

## Step 1: Specific Weight (γ)

Specific Weight is:

    γ = Weight / Volume

Where:  
- γ = specific weight in lbs/ft³  
- Weight = 1,800 lbs  
- Volume = 210 ft³

---

### Step 2: Apply the formula

    γ = 1,800 / 210

---

### Step 3: Divide

    γ ≈ 8.5714 lbs/ft³

---

### Step 4: Include units

    Specific Weight, γ ≈ 8.57 lbs/ft³

---

## Step 2: Specific Gravity (SG)

Specific Gravity is the **ratio of the fluid’s density to water’s density**:

    SG = γ_fluid / γ_water

Where:  
- γ_water ≈ 62.4 lbs/ft³ (standard at 4°C)  
- γ_fluid = 8.5714 lbs/ft³ (from Step 1)

---

### Step 3: Apply the formula

    SG = 8.5714 / 62.4

---

### Step 4: Divide

    SG ≈ 0.137

---

## Step 5: Include units

- Specific Gravity is **dimensionless** (ratio, no units)

---

## Answer

- Specific Weight:  
    γ ≈ 8.57 lbs/ft³  

- Specific Gravity:  
    SG ≈ 0.137

# Note: Specific Gravity and Specific Weight

---

## Specific Weight (γ)

- **Definition:** Specific weight is the **weight of a substance per unit volume**.  
- **Formula:**  

    γ = Weight / Volume

- **Units:** lbs/ft³ (US customary) or N/m³ (SI)  
- **Meaning:** It tells you **how heavy a fluid or material is for a given volume**.  
- **Example:**  
  - If 1 ft³ of hydraulic oil weighs 57 lbs, then:  

        γ = 57 lbs / 1 ft³ = 57 lbs/ft³

---

## Specific Gravity (SG)

- **Definition:** Specific Gravity is the **ratio of the density (or specific weight) of a substance to the density (or specific weight) of water** at standard conditions.  
- **Formula:**  

    SG = γ_fluid / γ_water  

  or  

    SG = ρ_fluid / ρ_water

- **Units:** Dimensionless (no units)  
- **Meaning:** It tells you **how heavy a fluid is compared to water**.  
- **Example:**  
  - If hydraulic oil has γ = 57 lbs/ft³ and water has γ = 62.4 lbs/ft³, then:  

        SG = 57 / 62.4 ≈ 0.914

- **Note:**  
  - SG < 1 → lighter than water  
  - SG > 1 → heavier than water

### Key Difference

| Concept | What it Measures | Units |
|---------|----------------|-------|
| Specific Weight (γ) | Weight per unit volume | lbs/ft³ or N/m³ |
| Specific Gravity (SG) | Ratio of fluid density to water | Dimensionless |
