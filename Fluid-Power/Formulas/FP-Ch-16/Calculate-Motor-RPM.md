# Calculating Motor RPM

We are given:

- Motor displacement = 5 cubic inches per revolution (in³/rev)  
- Flow supplied = 18 gallons per minute (GPM)  
- Goal: Find motor speed in RPM

---

## Step 1: Understand the formula

The volumetric relationship for a hydraulic motor:

    RPM = Flow / Displacement

Where:  
- Flow in **in³/min**  
- Displacement in **in³/rev**  

Since flow is given in GPM, first convert GPM → in³/min:

    1 gallon = 231 in³  
    Flow(in³/min) = Flow(GPM) × 231

---

## Step 2: Convert flow to cubic inches per minute

    Flow = 18 × 231 = 4158 in³/min

---

## Step 3: Apply the formula

    RPM = Flow / Displacement
    RPM = 4158 / 5

---

## Step 4: Divide

    RPM = 831.6 rev/min

---

## Step 5: Include units

    Motor Speed ≈ 832 RPM

---

## Answer

Motor Speed:

    RPM ≈ 832 rev/min


## Notes

- 231 cubic inches = 1 U.S. gallon.
    - It comes from the legal definition of the U.S. liquid gallon, not from hydraulics.
    - Every GPM to cubic-inch conversion in mobile or industrial hydraulics depends on this constant.

- Motors are rated in cubic inches per revolution (in³/rev).
    - Flow from pumps/meters is usually gallons per minute (GPM).
    - Multiplying by 231 converts the flow into matching volume units so the division works.
