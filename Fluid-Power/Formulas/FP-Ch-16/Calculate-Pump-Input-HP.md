# Calculating Pump Input Horsepower

We are given:

- Pump pressure = 400 psig  
- Flow rate = 22.5 GPM  
- Goal: Find **input horsepower (HP)**

---

## Step 1: Understand the formula

The hydraulic horsepower (ideal) can be calculated using:

    HP = (Pressure × Flow) / 1714

Where:  
- HP = horsepower  
- Pressure in **PSIG**  
- Flow in **GPM**  
- 1714 is a conversion factor for US units (PSI × GPM → HP)

> This formula assumes 100% pump efficiency. For real pumps, divide by efficiency if known.

---

## Step 2: Identify the values

- Pressure = 400 psig  
- Flow = 22.5 GPM

---

## Step 3: Apply the formula

    HP = (400 × 22.5) / 1714

---

## Step 4: Multiply numerator

    400 × 22.5 = 9000

---

## Step 5: Divide by 1714

    9000 ÷ 1714 ≈ 5.25 HP

---

## Step 6: Include units

    Input Horsepower ≈ 5.25 HP

---

## Answer

Input Horsepower:

    HP ≈ 5.25 HP


## Notes

- 1714 is a unit-conversion constant.
- It allows pressure in PSI and flow in GPM to produce an answer in horsepower.
- It is derived from the definition of horsepower and U.S. customary volume/length units.

- If units change, the constant changes.
    - Example:
        - bar & L/min → different number
        - PSI & cubic inches/min → different number

- But with PSI + GPM, it is always 1714.
