# Create an automated simulation using the following:

- 4/3 Directional Control Valve
- Q-type Displacement Pump
- C-type Tank
- C-type Piston
- Translational Mass
- Force Source
- Relief Valves as needed
- Hydraulic Volumes as needed

## ECR signal loop

- Extend the Piston for 5 seconds
- Center the Piston for 5 seconds
- Retract the Piston for 5 seconds
- Center the Piston for 5 seconds
  - Repeat continuously
