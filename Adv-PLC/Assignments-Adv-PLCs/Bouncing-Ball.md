# Bouncing Ball

- Create a "bouncing ball" routine that is reminiscent of the Windows XP logo screen saver

## PARAMETERS:
- The routine will have only 1 Start/Stop toggle bit for normal operation 
- Once started, the routine must continually loop 
- Collision boundaries must keep the graphical element within the viewable area 
- Only use included graphical elements native to View Designer

## Instructor Note:
- I used -(L)- and -(U)- on interlocked branches and ADD / SUB, at 9 rungs.
- Previous classes have skipped that and used ADDs and MOVs only, no -(L)- or -(U)- at 7 rungs total.
