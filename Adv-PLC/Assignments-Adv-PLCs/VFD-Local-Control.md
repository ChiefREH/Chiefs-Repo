## GRADING:
- I will grade everyone based on the operation AND aesthetics of their project.
- This means you need to work very hard to create something visually stunning.
    - _I want Gene Roddenberry to weep at its magnificence!_
 
*Proper documentation and rung comments are mandatory.
 
### Remember: if the project doesn't work, you don't get paid.
