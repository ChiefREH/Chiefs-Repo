# BASIC PLCs

[Studio 5000 General Instructions PDF](https://literature.rockwellautomation.com/idc/groups/literature/documents/rm/1756-rm003_-en-p.pdf)

    
## SOFTWARE

- These assignments will be performed using:
    - RS Links software
    - Studio 5000 software
    - Studio 5000 Emulator (in classroom)
    - CompactLogix 5380 / 5069-L306ER PLC (in lab)

## NOTE
- There are videos in my YT playlist covering the basic instructions
- However, it is done using the old language, RS500 for MicroLogix
- Regardless of the interface, the instructions are nearly identical
- I highly recommend you grab a copy of RS500 to practice these skills
