# LIMIT SWITCH AND TERMINAL BLOCKS

Complete the following tasks:
- Properly wire (2) sets of TERMINAL BLOCKS to the TRANSFORMER secondary (X1/F1 - X2) 
- X1/F1 will act as the POSITIVE polarity (supply line)
    - X2 will act as the NEGATIVE polarity (return line) 
- Properly wire (2) sets of TERMINAL BLOCKS to the TRANSFORMER secondary (X1-X2) 
- Properly wire in (1) LIMIT SWITCH (LS) to the (+) TERMINAL BLOCK 
- Properly wire (2) LIGHTS to the LS N.O. and N.C. contacts (IN PARALLEL) 
    - Properly wire the returns to X2 via the (-) TERMINAL BLOCK 
- Properly install the FUSES into the MAIN POWER DISCONNECT box 

*Troubleshoot as needed

NOTE: X1-F1 is made via the FUSE

UPGRADE:
- _Introduce Terminal Blocks (TBs) for cleaner, more professional wiring runs_
