# MOTOR WIRING WITH PILOT + RUN + LIMIT SWITCH

Complete the following tasks: 
- Properly wire the 3-phase induction MOTOR for LOW VOLTAGE 
- Properly wire the MOTOR to the MOTOR STARTER output (T1, T2, T3) 
- Properly wire the MOTOR STARTER COIL to an N.O. START and N.C. STOP PUSH-BUTTON 
- Properly wire the PUSH-BUTTONS to the AUXILIARY CONTACTS (*2-| |-3) and the TRANSFORMER outputs (X1-X2) 
- Properly wire a PILOT LIGHT and RUN LIGHT to the N.O. and N.C. AUXILIARY CONTACTS (*5-|/|-7 and *4-| |-6) 
- Properly wire a LIMIT SWITCH into the control circuit ("downstream") 
- Properly wire the MOTOR STARTER input (L1, L2, L3) to the MAIN POWER DISCONNECT output (L1, L2, L3) 
- Properly wire the TRANSFORMER input (H1-H4) to the MAIN POWER DISCONNECT output (L1, L2) 
- Properly install the FUSES into the MAIN POWER DISCONNECT box
