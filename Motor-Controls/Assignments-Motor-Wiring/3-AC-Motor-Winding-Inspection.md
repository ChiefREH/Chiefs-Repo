Complete the following tasks:
- Sketch the coils common to a 9-wire, 3-phase AC induction motor 
- Use a multi-meter to check for continuity between individual coils 
    - Record the resistance values (in Ohms) for each set of coils 
- Use a multi-meter to check for continuity between the coil and casing
    - _We’re looking for paths to ground!_
