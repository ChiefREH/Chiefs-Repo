# IDENTIFY ASPECTS OF INDUSTRIAL ROBOTICS SAFETY

The majority of these topics are covered in lab.  Key points:
- Never turn your back to the robot while working in the Envelope
- Never approach the robot without the Teach Pendant in hand
- Do not let people get between you and your robot


Robotic safety in industrial environments is critical to prevent accidents, ensure worker safety, and maintain operational efficiency. Here are the major aspects of robotic safety in industrial robotics:

1. Risk Assessment
    - Hazard Identification: Analyze the robot's workspace to identify potential dangers (e.g., pinch points, high-speed motion).
    - Risk Evaluation: Evaluate the likelihood and severity of potential injuries.
    - Mitigation Strategies: Implement safety measures based on risk level.

2. Safety Standards and Regulations
    - Compliance with recognized standards such as:
    - ISO 10218-1 & 10218-2: Safety requirements for industrial robots.
    - ISO/TS 15066: Collaborative robot safety.
    - ANSI/RIA R15.06: U.S. standard harmonized with ISO 10218.
    - OSHA Guidelines: U.S. occupational safety regulations.
    - Ensures safety design and operation align with industry best practices.

3. Physical Safeguards
    - Safety Fencing / Barriers: Prevent unauthorized access to robot cells.
    - Interlock Systems: Disable robot movement when access doors are opened.
    - Emergency Stop Devices: Easily accessible buttons to immediately halt operations.
    - Light Curtains & Laser Scanners: Detect human presence and stop robot motion.

4. Robot Design and Configuration
    - Intrinsic Safety: Designing robots with limited force, speed, and motion range to reduce risk.
    - Redundancy and Fail-safes: Systems that ensure safe shutdown or recovery in case of malfunction.

5. Collaborative Robot (Cobot) Safety
    - Power and Force Limiting (PFL): Cobots operate within safe force thresholds.
    - Speed and Separation Monitoring: Adjust speed based on proximity to humans.
    - Hand Guiding Mode: Enables safe, direct human interaction with the robot.
    - Safety-rated Monitored Stop: Stops motion when a human enters the workspace.

6. Control System Safety Functions
    - Safety PLCs / Controllers: Certified controllers with built-in safety functions.
    - Safe Torque Off (STO): Prevents motors from generating torque.
    - Safe Speed Monitoring: Ensures robot speed remains within safe limits.
    - Zone Monitoring: Different safety levels based on robot’s location or task.

7. Training and Procedures
    - Operator Training: Workers must be trained on robot operation and emergency procedures.
    - Maintenance Protocols: Safe procedures for inspection, maintenance, and troubleshooting.
    - Lockout/Tagout (LOTO): Ensures energy sources are properly shut off before maintenance.

8. Monitoring and Diagnostics
    - Condition Monitoring: Continuously check robot and system health.
    - Fault Detection and Alerts: Immediate alerts for abnormal conditions.
    - Data Logging: Tracks safety incidents and performance trends for analysis.

9. Human Factors and Ergonomics
    - Design interfaces and interactions that minimize human error and fatigue.
    - Consider operator visibility, reach, and comfort when working near robots.

10. Regular Audits and Safety Validation
    - Periodic reviews of safety systems and procedures.
    - Validation tests to confirm that all safety measures work as intended.
